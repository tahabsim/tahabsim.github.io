      <p>Saw this linked to on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/browser-company-swift-windows">Daring Fireball</a> the other day.</p>

<p>As of the past two weeks, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jrdn/110260516440991707">I've been using</a> Arc pretty heavily. While at first, I was a little confused about setting up the iOS app – turns out, you *have* to setup on the Mac first, and opening new tabs & closing them on iOS is confounding on initial use – I've grown to absolutely love it.</p>

<p>Turning the side-bar into not just websites but notes, drawings, and collections took some getting used to. After a while it grew on me, and now it's my main browser of choice.</p>

<p>Seeing that a Windows port is coming is fantastic – as my computer at the office is a Windows machine – and I hope that *eventually* boils over to an Android port as well. (While I doubt it will, if their end goal is large user-marketshare, as a Windows port and SDK allude to, it would be an eventual inevitability.)</p>

<p>Two thumbs up overall.</p>
