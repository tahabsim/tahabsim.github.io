      <p>Today, I'm moving my web log to this new site. It's terribly constructed hand-written HTML that took me most of a few hours.</p>

<p>I've had much fancier designs, and some really wonderful <a href="https://svbtle.com">blogging engines</a> under the hood &mdash; this is none of that. Every page, including the index, is written and updated by hand. I said to myself I'm too lazy to build a single script static site generator, so instead I'll do the pages and styling by hand. </p>

<p>There irony of that is hopefully very clear.</p>

<p>In the end, a simple, no-nonsense way was needed to get words on the Internet, on something I control. The design is something that'll be fiddled with over time (so please excuse its extreme crudeness), and undoubtedly some automated way of compiling it will be created in the near future.</p>

<p>For now, I have no excuse not to publish regularly. For well over a decade, I've experimented with some engines or site generators, switched everything over, made one post and started all over again. Now, the design will form around the content, as it goes along.</p>

<p>This early iteration of the site is experimenting with things like linked-posts. They may stay &mdash; they may not. Regardless, words need to be published, so that's the focus.</p>
